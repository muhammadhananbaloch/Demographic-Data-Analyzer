## Demographic Data Analyzer

This project is part of the Data Analysis with Python certification by freeCodeCamp. It involves analyzing demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database using Pandas. The analysis answers specific questions about the dataset, such as the average age of men, the percentage of people with different education levels, and more.

### Project Tasks:
1. Calculate the number of people of each race.
2. Determine the average age of men.
3. Find the percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree.
4. Calculate the percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate) earning >50K.
5. Calculate the percentage of people without advanced education earning >50K.
6. Identify the minimum number of hours worked per week.
7. Calculate the percentage of people working the minimum hours earning >50K.
8. Determine the country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K.
9. Identify the most popular occupation for those earning >50K in India.

### Development:
- Implemented the analysis in `demographic_data_analyzer.py`.
- Used `main.py` for testing my code during development.
- Ensured all calculations and code replaced the placeholder `None` values.

### Testing:
- Unit tests are available in `test_module.py`.
- Tests are imported into `main.py` for convenience.
